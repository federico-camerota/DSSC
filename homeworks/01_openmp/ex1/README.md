## Pi approximation

In this exercise we approximate pi using the mid point rule.

* [serial_pi.c](serial_pi.c) provides the serial implementation of the program.
* [parallel_pi.c](parallel_pi.c) provides the parallel implementation of the program
obtained from the serial version through the incremental parallelization approach
of OpenMP.
